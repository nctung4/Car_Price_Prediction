# Car Price Prediction

This project is a end-to-end data science project, from data collecting, to making it into production.

### Project Overview
* Created a tool that estimates car prices (RMSE:~293K, MAE:~293K HUF) to help people negotiate or estimate the specific price, when they want to either buy or sell a car.
* Used web scraping techniques to get the data from [hasznaltauto.hu](https://www.hasznaltauto.hu/). (hungarian car trading website)
* Applied several data cleaning and feature engineering techniques, such as handling missing data or feature scaling
* Optimized multiple linear regression, support vector regression, random forest regression, and xgboost.
* Build a client facing API using flask, and deployed it using heroku (PAAS): https://nctung-car-price-pred.herokuapp.com/

### Resources used
**Python Version:** 3.8.5 <br>
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sickit-learn, xgboost, selenium, beautifulsoup4, Flask, gunicorn, requests <br>
**Requirements:** ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
